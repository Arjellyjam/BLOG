            <p style="color: rgb(58, 76, 128); text-align: center;"> Hello! My name is Arjan Sidhu, also known as -1maginary_jam, and I am an aerospace/mechatronics enthusiast. I have made several projects, spanning from an autonomous flying UAV to grounded projects like a boston dynamics dog all powered from arduino.</p>
            <p style="text-align: center; color: rgb(58, 76, 128)"> I have also made software programming projects that include an AI powered CAD software and numerous games in Unity/ Python.</p>

          <p1 style="text-align: center; color: rgb(58, 76, 128);">This project was one of my first, and allowed me to enter the field of aeronautical engineering. Though, starting of with a drone was much more complex and required a lot more of my time.</p1>

          <p1 style="text-align: center; color: rgb(58, 76, 128);">After my take on an arduino powered drone, I moved on to building an autonomous flying UAV, with my friend, that could scout around a local area and make way for more projects in the future.</p1>
